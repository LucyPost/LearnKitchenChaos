# LearnKitchenChaos
 An exercise in expanding the single-player portion of Code Monkey's KitchenChaos tutorial series into a mobile mini-game
The bulletin board cloud used in the project comes from the artist Howard Day's public unity project at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQcjsW8ldkw
The mobile telemetry input uses the Joystick Pack from the unity AssetStore
